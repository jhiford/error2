      <article>
        <p>
          There are days when I try to distract myself, to fill my time with tasks and thoughts, yet no matter what I do, everything leads back to you. I find myself yearning for your presence in ways that words can hardly express. It is not just a simple want, but a deep ache inside me — the kind of longing that makes my heart restless when you are not near.
        </p>

        <p class="italic">
          I yearn for the sound of your voice, the way it can turn an ordinary moment into something unforgettable. I yearn for your laughter, that music which brightens even the heaviest of days. I yearn for your gaze, the way your eyes seem to hold stories I want to spend a lifetime discovering.
        </p>

        <p>
          This yearning is not shallow or fleeting. It is born from the way you’ve touched my soul in ways I did not expect. I do not just miss you — I crave the moments that we have yet to live together. I imagine the little things: walking side by side, sharing quiet evenings, talking about everything and nothing at all. These simple dreams carry a beauty that keeps me awake at night, because my heart cannot stop reaching for them.
        </p>

        <div class="quote" aria-hidden="true">
          I do not yearn only for the grand moments, but for the ordinary ones too — the ones where love shows itself in the smallest details.
        </div>

        <p>
          I imagine seeing you smile across the table, holding your hand when words are not needed, and being the one who stands by your side when life feels uncertain. My yearning is not just about having you near; it is about giving myself completely, so that you always feel cherished, valued, and secure in my love.
        </p>

        <p>
          Sometimes yearning feels like a sweet kind of pain, because it reminds me how deeply I care for you. It tells me that my feelings are not passing emotions, but a truth that runs through my whole being. Every thought of you strengthens my resolve to never waste a moment if I am blessed with your time and trust. I want each second with you to matter, to be something you can look back on and smile, knowing you were loved with honesty and devotion.
        </p>

        <p>
          When I say I yearn for you, I mean that I long to build a life where you never question your worth to me. I long to be the one who sees your beauty even when you doubt it yourself. I long to be the one who supports your dreams and celebrates your victories, no matter how big or small.
        </p>

        <p class="italic">
          I yearn for you today, tomorrow, and for every day that lies ahead. And in that yearning, I find my deepest truth: you are the one I want, and my heart will never stop reaching for you.
